    "Techniques for detecting data drift include statistical tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-Square tests, drift detection metrics such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Wasserstein distance, window-based methods using fixed or expanding windows, ensemble methods that compare model predictions, supervised drift detection using train-test comparisons or concept change detection, and unsupervised methods like density estimation or clustering. Choosing the appropriate technique depends on the problem, data type, and available resources, and combining multiple approaches can enhance detection accuracy. Regular monitoring and timely drift detection ensure accurate and reliable machine learning models."
